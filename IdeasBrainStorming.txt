A mask relates strongly to human, but can be animals too, face / head

Quite like the rogue like / adventure upgrading the senses idea.

A like the rogue like because it leans on systems / programming.

I cant lean into an art heavy idea.

Would like to do 2D if possible, will be easier to get closer to a 'complete' game in the time
